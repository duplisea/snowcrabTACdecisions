## background

This takes a data limited harvest control rule and applies it to snow
crab from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The rule was developed for
Australian tanner crab by O’Neil and has a simple elegance. It was not
tested here in simulation but it just shows what the TAC decision would
have been given the crab abundance.
