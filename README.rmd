## background

This takes a data limited harvest control rule and applies it to snow crab from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The rule was developed for Australian tanner crab by O'Neil and has a simple elegance. It was not tested here in simulation but it just shows what the TAC decision would have been given the crab abundance.
